# arbitrary-p
Cpp, c, python a library for arbitrary precision calculations

In my work "Alien Pi in the Sky?" (2016) I set out a cpp based arbitrary precision package of functions that enable rational calculations to any desired level of precision. I have since worked on these functions to improve their functioning and to correct buried errors that can occur in particular cicumstances. The revised package is functnw.cpp available in this repository.
